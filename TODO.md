#Split comments
According to [the minimum information principle](http://www.supermemo.com/articles/20rules.htm), the comment should be split to the explaination of words and the comment of translations.
The second explaination will merge with first one, or create a branch of entry.
Then the comment field will be pure.

This can be implemented by tag the comment by hand or NLP. (NSLinguisticTagger?)
